#Exploration is a nice thing to aim for. Usually people aim to explore space, because we do not know much about it. Funny thing though is that we probably know more about space than we do about our own Planet. We have only scratched the surface of Earth and have a hard time diving to the deepest parts of the Ocean. 

##This is obviously no text to fit in a readme file. Therefore I suggest to create a new file which is a random collection of stories. The readme file should be kept clear, mayhaps move this?
